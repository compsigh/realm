# `edwardshturman/home`

This is a personal site I'm building to play around with — and get more comfortable using — the Next.js App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind.

This is intended to eventually replace [my current personal site](https://edwardshturman.com) *(quite outdated)* which I made using Notion and [Fruition](https://fruitionsite.com).

As I experiment with new libraries, I'll probably add them in. One I'm eyeing right now is [Medusa](https://medusajs.com).

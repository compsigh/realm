# Realm FAQ

## Why is Realm a subscription?

I get it — I don't like subscriptions either. I wrote a post here about my thoughts on when I think they're fair play. The TL;DR on that is that I believe subscriptions are fair if:

1. There is an ongoing maintenance cost associated with the product
2. The product is a *bundle* of things
3. The product significantly improves over time

For Realm, all of these are true. We have hosting costs, OpenAI fees, and keep in mind we're a dev team of college students, lol. More importantly for you, though, Realm is literally five bots in one, and you get updates for free as part of that subscription.

We think this is a fair and consistent way of delivering our fun little project to you, and I hope you understand <3
